                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>Every time I think I understand how to write functions I realize I don't know it as well as I think. 
                    The concept absolutely makes sense to me but I moreso have problems with understanding the console.log and 
                    action parts. I also freeze when I have to write them from scratch.
                </p>

            <div id="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> I can't get it to show on my page but it turns up correctly in inspect.

                </p>
