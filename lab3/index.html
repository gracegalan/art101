				<p>I am a 26 year old queer woman from a little bit of everywhere. I was born in a tiny farm town in northern
					Illinois but moved to Whittier, CA after my mom met my dad and married him when I was 14. Moving between 2
					vastly different places was the first major shift in my life that positively lead me down the path 
					of becoming who I am today. I am an artist, a scholar, and a lover in so many capacities. I am passionate 
					about creating safe spaces for all people and appreciate the nuance in everyone. I am currently on a path 
					toward becoming a high school teacher where I hope to research and implement new ways to make classroom spaces 
					accommodating and accessible to teenagers with mental health and behavioral disorders.

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to create a file for the class. We did this together by downloading a template
						on the first day. I added an "about me" to the lab html template with a photo then modified the 
						CSS to give a lizard-tank vibe like in my picture.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The hardest part for me was wrapping the text around the photo. I used the Wes Bot to help me with 
						the code but it only worked for the paragraph, not the header. I asked in section as well but the 
						solution offered didn't work the way I wanted it to. I ended up just moving the header to above the 
						minor-section. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I would still like to learn how to properly wrap texts and headers on my page so I plan to check in 
						during section. This lab was very easy because a majority of it was already done before we started.
