				<p>I am a 26 year old queer woman from a little bit of everywhere. I was born in a tiny farm town in northern
					Illinois but moved to Whittier, CA after my mom met my dad and married him when I was 14. Moving between 2
					vastly different places was the first major shift in my life that positively lead me down the path 
					of becoming who I am today. I am an artist, a scholar, and a lover in so many capacities. I am passionate 
					about creating safe spaces for all people and appreciate the nuance in everyone. I am currently on a path 
					toward becoming a high school teacher where I hope to research and implement new ways to make classroom spaces 
					accommodating and accessible to teenagers with mental health and behavioral disorders.
