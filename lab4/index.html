			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty straightforward! The biggest challenge for us was more operational. We both had funky schedules 
						so it took some time and flexibilty to line everything up to complete the lab together.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were fortunate to not have any problems with this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I will be curious to see the way this new learned skill acts as a building block for the JS we learn 
						moving forward in the course.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"
					<pre><code>
						<ol>
						<li>initialize the grid with empty cells</li>
						<li>set up two players, each with a set of pieces</li>
						<li>Main game loop:</li>
  							<ol>
							<li>display the current state of the grid</li>
 							<li>ask the current player for their move and chosen column</li>
 							 <li>if the move is valid:</li>
    							<ol>
							 	<li>place the player's token in the specified column on the board</li>
    							<li>check for a win</li>
    							<li>check for a tie </li>
								
   							 <li> switch to the next player</li></ol>
							</ol>
						<li> display the winner or declare a draw</li>
						</ol>
