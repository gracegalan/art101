                    <p>My name is Grace Galan and I am a 4th year Lit major at UCSC. My favorite books are Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and Parable of the Sower. I want to teach high school English Lit when I am done with school. In my free time I love to make art, spend time with my friends, and explore new coffee shops.</br> </br> Hey my name is Maya! I like to draw in my freetime, and for work sometimes. I've designed a logo for a race, and stickers for small businesses! Not too familiar with coding yet but excited to keep going with it!</p>
