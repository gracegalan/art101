					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I'm going to be so honest I felt really out of my depth with this lab. 
                        I know its because I missed multiple classes from being sick but now I'm 
                    sick with both strep and a cold and it's making doing homework VERY difficult.</main> </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I wish we had another week of class to go over the last labs instead of 
                        being so overwhemled with final details of the final project that we're mostly 
                        focusing on that. I'd definitely say my struggles are mostly coming from my sickness.
                    </p>
