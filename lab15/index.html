					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Choose an API, test the endpoint, and use AJAX to get information from an 
                        external source.
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I think the hardest part for me was that I didn't attend class in person, 
                        I watched the lecture online. It seemed like it made sense to me but when I went to 
                         start, I had a lot of difficulty even following along the lab page.  </p>
