            <h3>3.75/5 stars</h3>
            <p>I'm not normally a self-help book person but this book was an easy listen on audibles and I did take a few things from the ideas present. I love the idea that there are types of people we want to be and habits we want to have; if we want to truly absorb these habits and become the type of person we imagine, we must actualize it in our behavior. If you want to be the type of person who runs every day, BE a runner. Starting small and building from tiny versions of a habit we want in our life is the most effective way to do it.</p>

            <h3>4/5 stars</h3>
            <p>This book took me until about half-way to actually become invested in the story. That being said, once I got into the rhythm of the story telling and was invested in the main character, I was hooked. I think this book is a beautiful tale about the life of a witch, woman, and mother in exile making the best of her solitude.</p>
